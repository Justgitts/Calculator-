# Calculator App

## Short Description
The Calculator App is a mobile application designed to provide users with a convenient and user-friendly tool for performing various mathematical calculations on their smartphones. With a clean and intuitive interface, the app aims to simplify complex computations and enhance productivity for users across different age groups and professions.

## Problem Statement
The Calculator App is addressing the need for a reliable and efficient calculator solution that goes beyond basic arithmetic operations. Many existing calculator apps lack advanced mathematical functions, intuitive design, and ease of use, leading to user frustration and reduced productivity. Our app aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive set of features while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

## In Scope (Features/Functions)
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Advanced Scientific Functions: Trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential calculations.
- Memory Functions: Store and retrieve previous calculations.
- Unit Conversion: Convert between different units (e.g., length, weight, temperature).
- Customization: Allow users to personalize the app's appearance and preferences.
- History Log: Track and review past calculations.
- Accessibility: Ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities through accessibility features.
- Cross-platform Support: Develop versions for both Android and iOS devices.

## Risks
1. **Competition Sabotaging:** As the calculator app market is competitive, there is a risk of competitors trying to sabotage the app's reputation through negative reviews or unethical practices. To mitigate this, the team will focus on delivering a high-quality, bug-free product and maintain transparent communication with users to build trust.

2. **Users Resisting Change:** Users might be hesitant to switch from their familiar calculator apps to a new one. To overcome this, the team will focus on providing a seamless transition by incorporating familiar UI elements and conducting user feedback sessions for continuous improvement.

3. **Internet Access Cost:** The app might require an internet connection for certain features like unit conversion or updates. To address this, the app will be designed to work offline as much as possible, and data usage will be optimized to minimize costs for users with limited internet access.

By addressing these risks and focusing on delivering a feature-rich, user-friendly, and reliable Calculator App, we aim to create a tool that becomes the preferred choice for users seeking an efficient and intuitive way to perform mathematical calculations on their mobile devices.
